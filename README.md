Bluegate cipher projects - This is one of the Bluegate cryptography solutions-based projects, which was built on a knowledge of Caesar cipher's conventional principle. 
This is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter that has a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. 

Practical example: With a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.
This Tool will be able to decrypt/encrypt your communication/messages based on the shift_method you use. What is so exciting about this tool is; that to decode the message or communication sent to the other party you need to know the exact key (in the form of shift_method) that is used to encode the message. The more digits you use as your key (the shift_methode), the more it will be difficult to decode the messages or communication.

It will likely require more than 3650 days to hack into the communication if a 3-digit key(shift_method) is used. This tool was built on the principle of Caesar cipher with comprehensive code modification to block/patch existing vulnerabilities in the code. All forms of decrypting techniques/brute force/cyber-attack have been used on the encrypting messages/communications encoded by the Bluegate Cipher with no success.

All cybersecurity professionals are welcome to perform any form of attack on the encrypting messages encoded by the Bluegate Cipher tools and report their feedback accordingly. Thank you for visiting and using the tools.
