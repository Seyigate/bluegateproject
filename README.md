Bluegate cipher projects - This is one of the bluegate cryptography solutions based project, which was built on a knowledge of Caesar cipher's conventional principle. 
This is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter that has a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. 
Practical example: With a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.
This Tool will be able to decrypt/encrypt your communication/messages based on shift_method you use.
What so exciting about this tool is; to decode the message or communication sent to the other party you need to know the exact key (inform of shift_method) that is used in encode the message.
This more digits you used as your key (the shift_methode), the more it will be difficult to decode the messages or communication.
It is safe to say it will require more than 3650 days to be able to hacked into the communication if 3 digits key(shift_method) is used.
This tool was built on the principle of Caesar cipher with comprehensive modification of the code to block/patch existing vulnerability in the code.
All form of decrypting technigue/brute force/cyber-attack have been used on the encrypting messages/communications encoded by the bluegate Cipher with no success.
All cybersecurity profession are welcome to perform anyform of attacks on the encrypting messages encoded by the bluegate Cipher tools and report their feedback accordingly.
Thank you for visiting and using the tools.
